# Premise

After Dice Tower West 2022, I was a little disappointed that I wasn't
able to play Beyond the Sun. I would have like to see what the alpha
gamers liked and didn't like about the game.

Then I started thinking about Blizzard-izing the game, stealing as
much as I could from it, keeping the tiny nugget that makes it unique
and polishing it until it is fun.

# Elements

- The game has cards that are tiers into four levels of
  technology. The final level are victory condition technologies.
- The cards serve dual roles, they provide some kind of action when
  played on the tableau but also provide resources when spent. Maybe
  the cards can be arranged in a way to easily show this. The game
  could also be simpler by just allowing cards to be discarded as
  generic resources. The higher tiered tech could be worth more
  resources.
  - the suit of the card could produce the same suit of resources
- Players can play a worker on a card to take an action thus the
  players define new actions. There can be few actions available on a
  tech in order to make competition for the spot. We can start with a
  large number of spots. If there are infinite placement spots then we
  won't need workers.
- Cards have suited requirements. Each one requires one or two
  incoming suits.
- Cards have arrowed "required by" and provide a single suit into
  that.
- Cards are placed in a stack. New tech can only be placed to the
  right of a group of three cards and needs to satisfy all
  requirements.
- If all cards are placed in a shared space, and we want them to
  provide game end VP, income, or other, then players will need to
  place ownership tokens on them.
  - we can use the same space for both the first player to play on the
    card as well as subsequent players.
  - The first player may have multiple placements to give them an
    advantage; alternatively we could have the advantage simply be
    placing the tech and changing the game state.
- not sure about game end. It could be depth requirements or breadth
  requirements.

# Actions

This section describes both what actions a placment may do as well as
what bonuses given by tech cards.

- Draw card
  - The simplest version of this is to just draw one card and keep one
    card.
  - We may want to limit it to a particular tech level or we could say
    up to tech level N.
  - bonus keep +N cards
  - bonus draw +N cards
- hand size
  - default is the same for everyone. Maybe start with three.
  - bonus +1 hand size
  - higher tech could have a bonus +2 hand size
- research/build
  - research a level one tech
  - we should follow BtS and not make separate actions for original
    research and researching discovered tech
  - research can be additive so additional tokens can be placed on the
    same tech
  - card need to be paid to pay for the tech. Either dependency suit or
    output suit.
  - bonus -1 cost to card of a given suit
  - bonus -1 cost to a card of a given level
  - bonus draw a card to get a bonus; allow for other card drawing bonuses
  - bonus cards played as resources provide an extra bonus, maybe
    double bonus
  - bonus optional conversion of one suit to another
  - bonus ignore a dependency
- vp
  - All the fourth level cards provide vp but they don't have to.
  - fixed value
  - based on number of advancement tokens
  - based on number of techs of a given suit
  - based on variety of techs
  - area control?
  - first gets more

- we could choose to have some cards provide more powerful actions
  while other cards boost all actions of some type. I'm not sure if
  one of them is obviously simpler.

# Complications

We should start with a simpler game and add complications only when
they are necessary. This section gives me a dumping ground for these
ideas without overly complicating the initial design.

- research bonus for the person who created the tech
- dependency suit could be directional: horizontal, diag up, diag down
  - we could have complicated and/or requirements
- let's start with a single resource and see how fun the game could
  be. Adding multiple resources complicates the game but could also
  lead to interesting strategies. We could also create conversion
  actions that players could utilize.
- all cards have a value of 1
- all the different vp methods are interesting but maybe they don't
  help the game. Let's start with a single simple vp method for each
  color and level. Maybe it's different per level.

# First Game

The first game is going to be broken so I need to get over it.

## Basic Rules

- max hand size: 5
- starting cards: 3
- research tokens: 10

## Deck Construction Theme

- types of improvements
  - card draw; this can all be one action but there are some subtle
    different ones that we can treat differently
    - card draw (draw x cards)
    - card search (draw x cards, keep one card)
    - card shuffle (draw x cards, discard y cards)
  - research discount
  - research discount
  - build action
  - build discount
  - increase hand size

I like that draw and search could be different. I also like that build
and research are different. Maybe start with five suits?

- basic actions (level zero) pre-built
  - all players have one draw, one keep
  - draw
  - shuffle
  - build
  - research

- simple types of vp
  - each faction may place one token on card; same vp value
  - let's try this one: card can contain limited tokens; same value

- green: card draw
- white: increase hand size
- blue: card search
- black: card build, improve build
- red: card research, improve research

This is like the magic color circle. We can have some of the
dependencies be adjacent colors

player colors: yellow, cyan, ?, ?

- level zero: fully researched
  - green: action: draw 1, keep one, level 2 cards only
  - white: max hand size 4
  - blue: action: search 2, mix, discard 2, level 2 cards only
  - black: action: research (must have deps, cost of card in hand)
  - red: action: build  (must have deps, cost of card in hand), this can't be done in the first round?
- level one
  - pre-built
  - random order space between each one
  - no dependencies; anyone can play on any of these with a research
    action; maybe some special symbol on the bottom that means no
    dependencies
  - green: action: draw one, keep one
  - white: +1 hand size
  - blue: search +1 keep
  - black: action: build
  - red: action: research
- level two
  - if each color requires it's own color as a req, then there will be
    a max of three cards per color; maybe that's ok.
  - value of all level 2 cards is 1
  - green:
    - +1 draw, +1 keep for all draw actions
    - card draws may come from level 3 x2
    - 1 VP, one token per player
  - white:
    - +1 hand size
    - card searches may come from level 3
    - card draws may come from level 3
    - 1 VP, one token per player
  - blue:
    - action:
    - +2 search for all search actions
    - -1 discard for all search actions
    - card searches may come from level 3 x2
    - 1 VP, one token per player
  - black:
    - -1 cost for all build actions
    - card searches may come from level 3 x2
    - 1 VP, one token per player
  - red:
    - -1 cost for all follow actions
    - may follow level 3 x2
    - 1 VP, one token per player
- level 3
  - is there a thematic difference between level two and threes? It
    was going to be that three had actions but that's no longer the
    case.
  - we could make instants that can be discarded for a lot of value
    but that sounds like a complications
  - level three doesn't need to be better; it could just be that
    players have run out of level 2 spots
  - why don't I start making it identical to level 2 except that it's
    more expensive. If this is the case then why would you not
    research wide? Maybe VP is worth it.
  - green:
    - +2 draw, +2 keep
    - draw and build cards for level 4
    - 1 VP, one token per player
  - white:
    - +2 hand size
    - card searches and draws may come from level 4
    - 1 VP, one token per player
  - blue:
    - +3 search for all search actions
    - -2 discard for all search actions
    - card searches and follow may come from level 4
  - black:
    - -2 cost for all build actions
    - card searches and builds may come from level 4
    - 1 VP, one token per player
  - red:
    - -2 cost for all follow actions
    - card draws and follows may come from level 4
    - 1 VP, one token per player
- level 4
  - these should be victory point cards
  - maybe there should be a lot of them since players may be able to get many cards
  - vp
    - one for each color that gives you vp for each color researched
    - large single vp values for each color: 5
  - super powers for each card
    - build for free
    - research for free
    - keep up to hand size in draw
    - search? Shuffle discard into deck, choose 2 cards
    - double hand size, draw four cards

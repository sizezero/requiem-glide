# Premise

After Dice Tower West 2022, I was a little disappointed that I wasn't
able to play Beyond the Sun. I would have like to see what the alpha
gamers liked and didn't like about the game.

Then I started thinking about Blizzard-izing the game, stealing as
much as I could from it, keeping the tiny nugget that makes it unique
and polishing it until it is fun.

# Elements

- The game has cards that are tiers into four levels of
  technology. The final level are victory condition technologies.
- The cards serve dual roles, they provide some kind of action when
  played on the tableau but also provide resources when spent. Maybe
  the cards can be arranged in a way to easily show this. The game
  could also be simpler by just allowing cards to be discarded as
  generic resources. The higher tiered tech could be worth more
  resources.
  - the suit of the card could produce the same suit of resources
- Players can play a worker on a card to take an action thus the
  players define new actions. There can be few actions available on a
  tech in order to make competition for the spot. We can start with a
  large number of spots. If there are infinite placement spots then we
  won't need workers.
- Cards have suited requirements. Each one requires one or two
  incoming suits.
- Cards have arrowed "required by" and provide a single suit into
  that.
- Cards are placed in a stack. New tech can only be placed to the
  right of a group of three cards and needs to satisfy all
  requirements.
- If all cards are placed in a shared space, and we want them to
  provide game end VP, income, or other, then players will need to
  place ownership tokens on them.
  - we can use the same space for both the first player to play on the
    card as well as subsequent players.
  - The first player may have multiple placements to give them an
    advantage; alternatively we could have the advantage simply be
    placing the tech and changing the game state.
- not sure about game end. It could be depth requirements or breadth
  requirements.

# Actions

This section describes both what actions a placment may do as well as
what bonuses given by tech cards.

- Draw card
  - The simplest version of this is to just draw one card and keep one
    card.
  - We may want to limit it to a particular tech level or we could say
    up to tech level N.
  - bonus keep +N cards
  - bonus draw +N cards
- hand size
  - default is the same for everyone. Maybe start with three.
  - bonus +1 hand size
  - higher tech could have a bonus +2 hand size
- research/build
  - research a level one tech
  - we should follow BtS and not make separate actions for original
    research and researching discovered tech
  - research can be additive so additional tokens can be placed on the
    same tech
  - card need to be paid to pay for the tech. Either dependency suit or
    output suit.
  - bonus -1 cost to card of a given suit
  - bonus -1 cost to a card of a given level
  - bonus draw a card to get a bonus; allow for other card drawing bonuses
  - bonus cards played as resources provide an extra bonus, maybe
    double bonus
  - bonus optional conversion of one suit to another
  - bonus ignore a dependency
- vp
  - All the fourth level cards provide vp but they don't have to.
  - fixed value
  - based on number of advancement tokens
  - based on number of techs of a given suit
  - based on variety of techs
  - area control?

- we could choose to have some cards provide more powerful actions
  while other cards boost all actions of some type. I'm not sure if
  one of them is obviously simpler.

# Complications

We should start with a simpler game and add complications only when
they are necessary. This section gives me a dumping ground for these
ideas without overly complicating the initial design.

- research bonus for the person who created the tech
- dependency suit could be directional: horizontal, diag up, diag down
  - we could have complicated and/or requirements

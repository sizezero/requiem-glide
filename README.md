# Premise

After Dice Tower West 2022, I was a little disappointed that I wasn't
able to play Beyond the Sun. I would have like to see what the alpha
gamers liked and didn't like about the game.

Then I started thinking about Blizzard-izing the game, stealing as
much as I could from it, keeping the tiny nugget that makes it unique
and polishing it until it is fun.

# Elements

- The game has cards that are tiers into four levels of
  technology. The final level are victory condition technologies.
- The cards serve dual roles, they provide some kind of action when
  played on the tableau but also provide resources when spent. Maybe
  the cards can be arranged in a way to easily show this. The game
  could also be simpler by just allowing cards to be discarded as
  generic resources. The higher tiered tech could be worth more
  resources.
- Players can play a worker on a card to take an action thus the
  players define new actions. There can be few actions available on a
  tech in order to make competition for the spot. We can start with a
  large number of spots. If there are infinite placement spots then we
  won't need workers.
- Cards have suited requirements. Each one requires one or two
  incoming suits.
- Cards have arrowed "required by" and provide a single suite into
  that.
- Cards are placed in a stack. New tech can only be placed to the
  right of a group of three cards and needs to satisfy all
  requirements.
- If all cards are placed in a shared space, and we want them to
  provide game end VP, income, or other, then players will need to
  place ownership tokens on them.
- not sure about game end. It could be depth requirements or breadth
  requirements.
